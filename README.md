# AMEX Credit Default Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer credit default risk** using the **American Express (AmEx) Credit Default Dataset**.  
The objective is to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that helps identify customers who are likely to default on their credit payments.

This project demonstrates skills in **data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** using real-world, large-scale financial data.
